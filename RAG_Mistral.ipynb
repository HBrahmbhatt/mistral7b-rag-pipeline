        "**Objective**: The goal of this project is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using FAISS to extract information from a document and answer specific questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method**: In this project, we begin by extracting text from the provided Snow White story and dividing it into chunks of paragraphs, each representing distinct sections of the narrative. Once the text is processed into manageable chunks, we proceed to create FAISS indices. This indexing step allows the system to efficiently retrieve the most relevant paragraph chunks when a question is posed. By defining a parameter k, the system can fetch the top k most relevant paragraphs, ensuring focused and accurate retrieval. These selected paragraphs are then fed into the Mistral model as part of the prompt to generate answers based on the retrieved content. This approach seamlessly integrates text processing, efficient indexing, and generative modeling to produce precise answers.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Download the PDF File**  \n",
        "   I started by downloading the PDF file from a URL using the `requests` library. The file was saved locally with the name \"snowwhite2.pdf\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Load the PDF using PyPDF2**  \n",
        "   Next, I loaded the PDF using `PyPDF2`'s `PdfReader`. I then looped through each page and extracted the text, storing it in the variable `text`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Clean the Extracted Text**  \n",
        "   After extracting the text, I cleaned it by removing unnecessary multiple newline characters. To do this, I used a regular expression (regex) that replaced occurrences of multiple consecutive newlines (`\\n+`) with a single newline (`\\n`). This helped standardize the spacing between paragraphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Split Text into Paragraphs**  \n",
        "   To further structure the text, I split it into paragraphs based on section headers. I used another regex pattern that identified a newline followed by a number and a space (e.g., \"1 Introduction\"), which is common in this text for section headers. This allowed me to break the text at logical points, dividing it into more readable sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Print the Paragraphs**  \n",
        "   Finally, I printed each paragraph. Before printing, I made sure to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the paragraphs to get rid of overhead.\n"

        "\n",
        "1. **Importing Required Libraries:**\n",
        "   Firstly, I imported the necessary libraries:\n",
        "   - `faiss`: This is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.\n",
        "   - `numpy`: A library to handle large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.\n",
        "   - `SentenceTransformer`: A pre-trained transformer model that generates sentence embeddings (vector representations of sentences).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Defining `create_faiss_index` Function:**\n",
        "   - This function is responsible for converting a list of documents into vectors and storing them in a FAISS index.\n",
        "   - **Function Parameters:**\n",
        "     - `documents`: A list of textual documents that will be encoded into vectors.\n",
        "     - `encoder_model`: A pre-trained sentence transformer model used to encode the documents.\n",
        "   - **Steps:**\n",
        "     - I started by encoding the list of documents into vectors using the `encode()` method of the sentence transformer model. The result is a matrix where each row represents a document as a vector.\n",
        "     - Next, I initialize a FAISS index (`IndexFlatL2`), which uses L2 (Euclidean) distance to measure the similarity between vectors.\n",
        "     - Then, I added the document vectors to the FAISS index.\n",
        "   - **Return Values:**\n",
        "     - The function returns the FAISS index (`faiss_index`), which can be used to perform similarity searches later, and the original list of documents (`documents`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Defining `retrieve_documents` Function:**\n",
        "   - This function retrieves the top-k relevant documents from the FAISS index based on a search query.\n",
        "   - **Function Parameters:**\n",
        "     - `query`: A string representing the search query for which I want to retrieve relevant documents.\n",
        "     - `faiss_index`: The FAISS index created earlier that contains the encoded document vectors.\n",
        "     - `documents`: The original list of documents, used to retrieve the actual content based on the indices.\n",
        "     - `encoder_model`: The pre-trained sentence transformer model used to encode the query.\n",
        "     - `top_k`: An integer representing how many top relevant documents to return. The default is set to 3.\n",
        "   - **Steps:**\n",
        "     - First, I encoded the query into a vector using the `encode()` method.\n",
        "     - Then, I searched the FAISS index for the top-k nearest document vectors using the `search()` method of the FAISS index. This returns both the `distances` and the `indices` of the nearest neighbors.\n",
        "     - Using the indices, I retrieved the corresponding documents from the original list.\n",
        "   - **Return Value:**\n",
        "     - The function returns the list of `retrieved_docs`, which contains the top-k (here k = 3) documents most relevant to the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Using the Functions:**\n",
        "   - I initialized the sentence transformer model (`'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'`) and load a list of documents (`paragraphs`).\n",
        "   - Then, created the FAISS index using the `create_faiss_index()` function, which stores the document vectors.\n",
        "   - For a given query (e.g., `\"who is Snow White?\"`), I use the `retrieve_documents()` function to retrieve the top-k relevant documents.\n",
        "   - Finally, I printed the retrieved documents (`retrieved_docs`), which are the ones most similar to the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, this code effectively allows searching for documents that are semantically similar to a query by encoding them into vectors and using the FAISS index for efficient retrieval."

            "['Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\nJacob Grimm Wilhelm Grimm\\nAbstract\\nSnow White was a princess who lived long, long ago. Her mother died and her father\\nremarried. Her new stepmother wants to kill her because Snow White is more beautiful\\nthan she is. Then Snow White runs away and hides in a small cottage that belongs to\\nseven dwarfs. The stepmother ﬁnds her and kills her. A noble prince comes and kisses\\nher back to life and marries her. The stepmother goes to the marriage where she gets\\nkilled.\\nContents', '11 Introduction\\nOnce upon a time in the middle of winter, when the ﬂakes of snow were falling like feathers\\nfrom the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black\\nebony. And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked\\nher ﬁnger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And the red looked\\npretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself, would that I had a child as white as\\nsnow, with lips as red as blood, and hair as black as the wood of the window-frame.\\nSoon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, her lips were as red\\nas blood, and her hair was as black as ebony, and she was therefore called little snow-white.\\nAnd when the child was born, the queen died.', '5 The murder of Snow White\\n5.1 First attempt\\nBut the queen, believing that she had eaten snow-white’s lung and liver, could not but think\\nthat she was again the ﬁrst and most beautiful of all, and she went to her looking-glass and\\nsaid, looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall, who in this land is the fairest of all.\\nAnd the glass answered, oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see, but over the hills, where the\\nseven dwarfs dwell, snow-white is still alive and well, and none is so fair as she.\\nThen she was astounded, for she knew that the looking-glass never spoke falsely, and she\\nknew that the huntsman had betrayed her, and that little snow-white was still alive.\\nAnd so she thought and thought again how she might kill her, for so long as she was not the\\nfairest in the whole land, envy let her have no rest. And when she had at last thought of\\nsomething to do, she painted her face, and dressed herself like an old pedlar-woman, and no\\none could have known her. In this disguise she went over the seven mountains to the seven\\ndwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried, pretty things to sell, very cheap, very cheap. Little\\nsnow-white looked out of the window and called out, good-day my good woman, what have\\nyou to sell. Good things, pretty things, she answered, stay-laces of all colors, and she pulled\\nout one which was woven of bright-colored silk. This lace is very cheap: it only costs /Euro.0375,\\nwhich is a bargain, because on the Internet you won’t ﬁnd it below $10. Just check e-bay! I\\nmay let the worthy old woman in, thought snow-white, and she unbolted the door and bought\\nthe pretty laces. Child, said the old woman, what a fright you look, come, I will lace you\\nproperly for once. Snow-white had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let herself be laced\\nwith the new laces. But the old woman laced so quickly and so tightly that snow-white lost\\n4her breath and fell down as if dead. Now I am the most beautiful, said the queen to herself,\\nand ran away.\\nNot long afterwards, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home, but how shocked they were\\nwhen they saw their dear little snow-white lying on the ground, and that she neither stirred\\nnor moved, and seemed to be dead. They lifted her up, and, as they saw that she was laced\\ntoo tightly, they cut the laces, then she began to breathe a little, and after a while came to\\nlife again. When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, the old pedlar-woman was\\nno one else than the wicked queen, take care and let no one come in when we are not with\\nyou.\\n5.2 Second attempt\\nBut the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front of the glass and asked,\\nlooking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall, who in this land is the fairest of all.\\nAnd it answered as before, oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see, but over the hills, where\\nthe seven dwarfs dwell, snow-white is still alive and well, and none is so fair as she.\\nWhen she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for she saw plainly that\\nlittle snow-white was again alive. But now, she said, I will think of something that shall\\nreally put an end to you. And by the help of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a\\npoisonous comb. Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman. So\\nshe went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the door, and cried, good\\nthings to sell, cheap, cheap. Little snow-white looked out and said, go away, I cannot let\\nanyone come in. I suppose you can look, said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous comb\\nout and held it up. It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled, and opened the\\ndoor. When they had made a bargain the old woman said, now I will comb you properly for\\nonce. Poor little snow-white had no suspicion, and let the old woman do as she pleased, but\\nhardly had she put the comb in her hair than the poison in it took eﬀect, and the girl fell\\ndown senseless. You paragon of beauty, said the wicked woman, you are done for now, and\\nshe went away.\\nBut fortunately it was almost evening, when the seven dwarfs came home. When they saw\\nsnow-white lying as if dead upon the ground they at once suspected the step-mother, and\\nthey looked and found the poisoned comb. Scarcely had they taken it out when snow-white\\ncame to herself, and told them what had happened. Then they warned her once more to be\\nupon her guard and to open the door to no one.\\n5.3 Third attempt\\nThe queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said, looking-glass, looking-glass, on the\\nwall, who in this land is the fairest of all.\\nThen it answered as before, oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see, but over the hills, where\\nthe seven dwarfs dwell, snow-white is still alive and well, and none is so fair as she.\\nWhen she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage. Snow-white shall\\ndie, she cried, even if it costs me my life.\\n5Thereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room, where no one ever came, and there\\nshe made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked pretty, white with a red cheek, so that\\neveryone who saw it longed for it, but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die.\\nWhen the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed herself up as a farmer’s wife,\\nand so she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs. She knocked at the door.\\nSnow-white put her head out of the window and said, I cannot let anyone in, the seven dwarfs\\nhave forbidden me. It is all the same to me, answered the woman, I shall soon get rid of my\\napples. There, I will give you one.\\nNo, said snow-white, I dare not take anything. Are you afraid of poison, said the old woman,\\nlook, I will cut the apple in two pieces, you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white. The\\napple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned. Snow-white longed for\\nthe ﬁne apple, and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer,\\nand stretched out her hand and took the poisonous half. But hardly had she a bit of it in\\nher mouth than she fell down dead. Then the queen looked at her with a dreadful look, and\\nlaughed aloud and said, white as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood, this time the\\ndwarfs cannot wake you up again.\\nAnd when she asked of the looking-glass at home, looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\\nwho in this land is the fairest of all.\\nAnd it answered at last, oh, queen, in this land thou art fairest of all. Then her envious heart\\nhad rest, so far as an envious heart can have rest.']\n"

        "   - The retrieved documents act as \"context\" for answering the question. Think of it as finding useful paragraphs in a book before writing your answer.\n",

        "I faced an issue with how the paragraphs were divided. The text wasn't split into sections properly, which caused confusion and led to inaccurate answers. Using multiple spaces to separate paragraphs caused breaks at the end of pages and when sections changed. The fragmented text resulted in incomplete or mismatched information, making it difficult for the model to generate accurate responses due to the lack of clear context.\n",

        "For example, in the questions \"What happened to the wicked queen at Snow White's wedding?\" and \"What was the method used by the queen in her final attempt to kill Snow White?\", the information was unclear due to multiple references to the queen as \"she.\" The text was fragmented because I was only using line-based paragraph divisions. This made it confusing to understand whether the method of the iron shoes led to the queen's death or Snow White's. As a result, the answer to the question \"What was the method used by the queen in her final attempt to kill Snow White?\" ended up being something like, \"In her final attempt, the Queen killed Snow White by making her dance in hot iron shoes,\" which was inaccurate.\n",

        "\n",
        "To fix this, I changed my approach. Instead of relying on spaces, I used the number-word combination that usually starts each section, such as \"1. Introduction\" or \"2. Methods.\" This method allowed me to divide the text into well-defined sections, making sure that each paragraph stayed intact and in the correct place. It also helped organize the text more clearly and provided the model with much better context.\n",

        "After making these changes, I saw a significant improvement. The model was able to generate more accurate answers because it now had a better understanding of the context!"
